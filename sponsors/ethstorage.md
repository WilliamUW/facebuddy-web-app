$5,000: Build a Decentralized Social Network Using Web3:// and EthStorage

EthStorage is a layer 2 solution that provides programmable dynamic storage based on Ethereum's data availability. Web3:// (ERC-4804) establishes a standard for accessing decentralized applications and on-chain Web3 content, eliminating the necessity for the conventional HTTP URL format. 
The bounty pertains to the development of a decentralized Social Network using Web3:// and EthStorage.

Explanation for why FaceBuddy satisfies the requirements:

FaceBuddy leverages ETHStorageâ€™s decentralized and scalable storage to handle the large amounts of agent interaction log data generated during user flows that can scale to billions, allowing users to see who they connected with and who paid them, all on chain.
