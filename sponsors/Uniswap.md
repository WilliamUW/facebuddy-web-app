## ðŸ’° $7,500: Uniswap V4 on Unichain Innovation  

**Challenge:**  
An open-ended category for developers building on **Uniswap v4** projects on **Unichain**.  

**Why FaceBuddy?**  
FaceBuddy's **AI Agent** intelligently swaps tokens to the recipient's preferred currency using **Uniswap v4 on Unichain**. For example:  
- If the recipient wants **USDC** and the sender only has **ETH**, FaceBuddy will automatically swap the **ETH to USDC** on Uniswap v4 before sending the transaction.  
- This feature is essential for users who have **limited access to their wallet** and cannot afford the luxury of swapping tokens whenever they want.
