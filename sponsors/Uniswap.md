$7,500: Uniswap V4 on Unichain Innovation

An open-ended category for developers building on Uniswap v4 projects on Unichain

FaceBuddy’s AI Agent intelligently swaps tokens to the recipient’s preferred currency using Uniswap v4 on Unichain. For example, if the recipient wants USDC, Facebuddy will detect the sender only has ETH and automatically swap to USDC on v4 before sending. Receiving the right currency is essential for users who have sparse access to their wallet and don’t have the luxury or disposable income to swap tokens whenever they want.
