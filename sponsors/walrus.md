## ðŸ¦£ $6,000: Walrus Tusked Champion  

**Challenge:**  
We want to see a working project that:  
- Compiles and builds without obvious errors.  
- Has **well-documented readmes**.  
- Demonstrates **at least 2-3 major user flows** that integrate with **Walrus**.  
- Can be executed by anyone without encountering **non-recoverable errors**.  
- Accounts for **internet disruptions** and provides **backup options** for demos.

### **Why FaceBuddy satisfies the requirements:**

FaceBuddy leverages **Walrus's decentralized, efficient, and scalable storage** to handle large amounts of facial hash data during processing. This ensures:  
- **Reliable data availability** and **resilience**.  
- **Seamless execution** of user flows without errors, even at scale (up to billions of users).  

**Key Features:**
- FaceBuddy uses **Walrus storage** to store facial data securely and efficiently.  
- It integrates Walrus's storage and retrieval system to provide a smooth, error-free experience.
